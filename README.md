# cnijfilter-source-3.40
attempting to fix up the old canon source drivers for my Fedora server and canon MG8150 

inspired by (and code copied from) spremi's git
https://github.com/spremi/cnijfilter-source-3.80

Not a branch as these files are much older so not sure if compatible.  First attempt to just copy a couple of files into that repo failed so starting from scratch
